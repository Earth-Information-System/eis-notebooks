This repo contains jupyter notebooks to process and visualize water cycle components in the pre- and post-fire regime for Western U.S. 

The scripts are arranged as follows:

1.  - analyses vegetation impacts as observed from the OpenET's DisALEXI model
2.  - analyses vegetation impacts as modeled by the Noah-MP land surface model within the Land Information System (LIS) framework, involving data assimilation of multiple remote sensing observations

The respective data used in the notebooks is in the DATA/ folder.
