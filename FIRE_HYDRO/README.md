# Post-fire impacts on hydrology

This repo contains jupyter notebooks to process and visualize water cycle components in the pre- and post-fire regime for Western U.S., developed a spart of the Earth Information System (EIS) project.

The scripts are arranged as follows:

1. *fire-life-cycle-DisALEXI.ipynb*: analyses vegetation impacts as observed from the OpenET's DisALEXI model
2. *fire-life-cycle-LIS.ipynb*: analyses vegetation impacts as modeled by the Noah-MP land surface model within the Land Information System (NASA LIS) framework, involving data assimilation of multiple remote sensing observations

The respective data used in the notebooks is in the DATA/ folder.
